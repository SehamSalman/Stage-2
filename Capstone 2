# 📚 Smart Learning Management Platform – Capstone Project 2

## 🎯 Project Summary

This project focuses on **enhancing data quality, governance, and analytics** within a Learning Management System (LMS). The goal is to build a robust, cloud-based data infrastructure that ensures accurate, consistent, and compliant educational data, empowering data-driven decisions and improving the learner experience.

---


## 💡 Project Objective

With the growing reliance on e-learning platforms, educational data has become a key asset for understanding learner behavior and optimizing instructional design. However, many LMS platforms suffer from:

* Inconsistent and duplicated records
* Missing or poorly structured data
* Lack of privacy compliance and governance
* Limited ability to generate actionable insights

This project was developed to solve those issues by integrating multiple data sources into a centralized cloud database, applying data quality rules, enforcing data governance policies (including Saudi **PDPL** compliance), and creating interactive dashboards to support strategic decision-making.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tools

### 📥 Data Sources

* **PostgreSQL**: Main LMS database
* **CSV files**: Attendance records
* **MySQL (local)**: Phase 1 database

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

| Tool                      | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Airbyte**               | Data extraction and loading              |
| **SQL + Python**          | Data profiling, cleaning, transformation |
| **AWS RDS**               | Centralized cloud database               |
| **Google Sheets**         | Documenting data rules and metadata      |
| **Power BI / Dashboards** | Data visualization                       |

## 📊 Data Profiling & Quality

Initial profiling was performed using SQL and Python scripts to identify:

* Null and duplicate values
* Distinct value counts
* Field-level validations (e.g., email format, name structure)

We also developed **data quality rules** for critical columns like:

* `score` → must be between 0 and 100
* `question_ids` → must follow defined format
* `filename` → must use naming convention like `project_topic_task.zip`

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

* Removed duplicates with `DISTINCT`
* Filled missing values where applicable
* Standardized date/time formats using `DATE_FORMAT`
* Trimmed spaces and corrected naming conventions
* Merged datasets using SQL `UNION` into a unified schema `lms_dev`

---

## 🔐 Data Governance & PDPL Compliance

### Key Governance Principles

* **Data Quality**: Regular validation for accuracy, completeness, consistency
* **Transparency**: Full metadata documentation
* **Data Integrity**: Access control via roles and permissions

### PDPL Compliance

* **Masking PII**: Emails and names are obfuscated
* **User Rights**: Support for data access, correction, deletion
* **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is retained
* **Regular Audits**: To ensure compliance with Saudi data privacy laws

#### Example – Data Masking:

| Original Email        | Masked Email          |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `Marc.Kane@gmail.com` | `M********@gmail.com` |

## 📈 Analytics & Dashboards

We created interactive dashboards to visualize:

* Student enrollment and completion
* Attendance trends by cohort
* Program-wise progress and distribution
* Learning formats (online vs. onsite)

## ⚠️ Challenges Encountered

* Integrating structured and semi-structured data from **three different sources**
* Unifying **attendance formats** for Client 1 and Client 2
* Resolving **inconsistent student status** fields across multiple tables
* Enforcing **privacy rules** and **governance policies** throughout the pipeline

---

## ✅ Outcomes

* Built a **centralized database** using AWS RDS
* Cleaned, transformed, and validated **900+ student records**
* Implemented **data quality checks and PDPL-compliant masking**
* Developed dashboards that provide **actionable educational insights**
